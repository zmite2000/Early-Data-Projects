**Description:**

    This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.
    2 pages in Power BI.
    Includes KPI cards, Pie charts, bar charts, and RFM analysis.

Process:

I first learned of the problem presented in its entirety and its requirements for approval. Then, I chose software and created my first submission, the "Decomposition Plan". After, I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards for a second submission. Lastly, I presented my findings in a report as my 3rd and final submission piece.
Data

TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 2 for this project.

    'Zomato data.zip': Compressed Excel files provided by team lead
        'orders': All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th, 2017, and June 26th, 2020.
        'users': All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
    'Measures Table': Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all used measures.
    'Calendar': Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all date information for potential calculations.
    'Segmentations': Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all segments and RFM scores needed for inclusion.
    'RFM Table': Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all RFM calculations.

Assumptions:

    The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
    Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
    The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
    The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
    Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

Findings:

    Customers mostly consist of 23-year-old unmarried men.
    There is a natural distribution for age however the range is small at 18-34.
    Women are close behind, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.
    Zomato’s customers usually have small family sizes (2-3), educated, but unemployed.
    Employed customers tend to be below middle class ($50,000/yr).
